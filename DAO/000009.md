# One DAO to secure them all (🦀, 📜) ☯️
![capped_profit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1236584/164290419-13608416-89a1-4b3e-a4ae-1a31e5ba32ea.png)

Having...
- concluded several [audits](https://github.com/securityDAO/audits)
- experimented with [soft governance](https://element.io/blog/element-welcomes-polls/) [artifacts](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4102-prop-17-unity-win-win-win)
- on-chain code-based governance [for stuff that matters™]() implementing desiderata from the [versioned soft consensus artifacts](https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1516806690804432897)

... **we are ready to put all of our `$TOKEN` where our proverbial mouth3 is at and consolidate [governance](), treasury, and bounty management to a [single VERY public DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1p9w4u6nlrwc6gdg3cyrvzlh3tuacsyqfl4vadkh02pjeh0zsrnksd93z0c)
that was born on-chain [January 31st, 2022](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/txs/6E698161F98C5A45B3F46041BEC42A48420E77A33F2A89AD47E409AD305DA8C1)**

While us not finding areas of _immediate_ concern does imply some amount of security, no system is [ever fully secure](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/introduction.html),
and in effect our treasury now forms a self-funding bounty. [If you can take it, it's yours](https://twitter.com/dystopiabreaker/status/1514415972702072838?s=20&t=-NFfDo7taMXwCovNwfdumw). 🏴

**NOTE:** _this is not a public liquid token offering of any kind, `$SEC` token is for governance only!_
non-fungibility will be guaranteed in future gov contract iterations, but in terms of material fact,
if you can somehow get `$SEC` and then open an incentivized [secondary market](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/) for it,
we cannot stop you (yet!). If you find a way to buy governance, it's yours. 🏴

**ALSO NOTE:** while the DAO was instantiated using [crates.io:sg_dao:0.2.5](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/wasm/code/43) - [its source code](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.5) is in effect a provisional securityDAO constitution,
we are eagerly anticipating mainnet launch of [DAO DAO contracts v1](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/txs/794F6A60C59B605F4C33F8AA987DD891253E3F900BF3F406EA9B637D22FF2EF0),
as well as DAO DAO SDK and will be transitioning to `v1` contracts in the near future.
We will continue to [perpetually evolve](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/PermanentRevolution.jpg) our contracts on the road to the more perfect consensus w/ artisanally crafted incentives that lead to [better games](https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1503308154104287238?s=20&t=v3obL8RCIKDUUrwjnX9m2Q).

As proclaimed by the billboards in Austin in the run-up to SXSW2022, [crypto is peaceful revolution {...}](https://mobile.twitter.com/nincoroby/status/1502105215851544591)
and today - **2022-04-20 🌱** - marks one such turning point for securityDAO.
