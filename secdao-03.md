# Goals
Estabilish a bounty pool system on a monthly cadence ( All bounties are determined / outlined at the begining of a month based on yield farming and validator rewards only. The bounty payout will never be allowed to exceed the weekly rewards. If a multiweek bounty were to exceed the max cap for the week, the total bounties for the week would added together and payed out each week on a linearly scaled basis to each of the recipients. This will reset at the end of the month or defined sprint end
the first week of a month or sprint shall be reserved for planning, learning
Total compensation bounty pool weekly payout is to be no more than treasury staked rewards and validator rewards per week
90% of bounty pool is pre-accolated to vision-centric main pool tasks related to grants, audits, or smart contracts . Examples of tasks that qualify for main pool include audit template, audit sales, audit formatting, audit drafting, audit intake and presales, grant drafting, audit vulnerabilty finding, and smart contract development.
Examples of tasks that are explicitly excluded from the main pool tasks are all non-rust software development efforts, devops tasks, cloud infrastructure management tasks, validator-related maintaince / monitoring, travel to conferences, internal time spent on bounty system interactions, git issue curation tasks, and social media posts\
bounties will not be able to be stolen by other non-initiating members without consent of the bounty initiating member if the bounty is within a predefined estimated completion window during a sprint
bounties that are stolen will only return 75% of the original to the non-initiating member and with the initiating member receiving 25% pending a multisig vote with 50% of members voting in favor.
normal bounties shall be deemed completed by a multisig vote with 50% of members voting in favor
SecDao may vote to make grants out of the treasury as a year end bonus with only a simple majority vote. Daoist must be contributing for at least 6 months to be eligbile to be included on the year end multisig.
Deviations from this compensation policy may only be completed by a 2/3 majority vote where the beneficiary (person or persons benefitting) are forced to abstain in their vote.
90% of treasury shall be put into yield bearing assets outside of immediate bounty pay and unexpected expenses fund
