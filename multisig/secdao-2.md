# Compensation Freeze, Compensation Adjustment, Bounty Pool Establishment 
## Why

Current compensation of 256 Juno UBI per week is not sustainable for the future.  Current budget allocation is misaligned with Dao's needs and goals.  If previous plans had worekd out and everyone had executed successfully we would not be in this situation. 

The main causes are that the initial DAO grant was never intended to support more than 1-2 people and only through Feb 2022, the DAO is not being compensated at levels comparable to what competition is charging for audits, the second big audit for us (DaoDao) is not paying a market rate for the audit in raw tokens, the audit pipeline sales lifecycle is slower than initially percieved, the team working on the validators has failed to deliver a working mainnet validator in a timely way, and the team has not chosen to persue an equity/token compensation model that would be amenable to raising capital from investors. 

Almost all early stage startups compensate members at rates far below what we are currently compensating members at.  Addtionally, the original members have now recieved between 50-70k equivalent in JUNO.  One option to bring pay into line with other starups / daos would be to freeze compensation at around 50-70K for the entire first year compensation.  

Instead of proposing an annual pay freeze, this proposes to freeze pay for two weeks to submit further grants and continue developing sales leads in order to reduce the uncertainty around near term funding and sales.  This will also change the compensation to be fixed to only be based on renewable sources of treasury yield instead of eating out of the principle.   

To rectify this situation this proposals seeks to enact the following actions:

* Immediately freeze all compensation for 2 weeks 
* Estabilish a bounty pool system on a monthly cadence ( All bounties are determined / outlined at the begining of a month based on yield farming and validator rewards only.  The bounty payout will never be allowed to exceed the weekly rewards.  If a multiweek bounty were to exceed the max cap for the week,  the total bounties for the week would added together and payed out each week on a linearly scaled basis to each of the recipients. 
* Total compensation bounty pool is to be no more than treasury staked rewards and validator rewards per week 
* 90% of bounty pool is pre-accolated to vision-centric tasks related to grants, audits,  or smart contracts.  Examples of tasks that qualify for this pool include audit template, audit sales, audit formatting, audit drafting, audit intake and presales, grant drafting, audit vulnerabilty finding, and smart contract development. Examples of tasks that are explicitly excluded from this are all non-rust software development efforts, devops tasks, cloud infrastructure management tasks, validator-related maintaince / monitoring, travel to conferences, internal time spent on bounty system interactions, git issue curation tasks, and social media posts. 

These actions will allow us to establish a sustainable compensation floor for the DAO which will steadily increase with time.  By focusing on sustainablity, we can remove the runaway concerns and focus more on execution and delivery.
