# Coordination tooling - email, calendar, corresponding domain
## Why
In the course of engaging with other DAOs, audit targets, and external services over email, the active DAO members need to maintain security and privacy of the data compatible with the threat model of security organization.

Calendar is required for efficient coordination of meeting times and event agendas.

Additionally, other collaboration often rely on email as a web2 identity and a password reset mechanism.

## Actions to be carried out off-chain
- secure secdao.xyz domain
- get 5 seats of ProtonMail professional for Mail / Calendar
- request for active users to create Google accounts using their ProtonMail @secdao.xyz address
- adjust accounts on any existing DAO services (e.g. LucidChart) to use @secdao.xyz emails
- rename GitHub organization to match, i.e. `wasmsec` -> `secdao`
- start using the ProtonMail calendar as a coordination tool for aligning on meetings

## Costs
secdao.xyz - 3 years - $30
ProtonMail - 5 seats - $375 (renews anually)
+ tax
